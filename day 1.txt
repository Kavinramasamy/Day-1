1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

	* HTTP1.1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, 
while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
	
	* HTTP1.1 is slower when compared to HTTP2.


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

	* In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
Compare it with a car, for example. A car is an object, with properties. A car has a color, 
a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have
properties, which define their characteristics.

	* The syntax of creating object in javascript is,
	
	object={key:value,
		key1:value1,
		........
		keyN:valueN}
key and values are separated by colon(:).
